# ColorAware â€“ Real-Time Color Detection for Colorblind Assistance

**ColorAware** is a real-time computer vision project designed to help people with color vision deficiency (colorblindness) identify colors through distinct overlays, labels, and analysis panels.  
It detects **red, green, blue, and yellow** in live webcam feed and visually distinguishes them using patterns and textual cues.
